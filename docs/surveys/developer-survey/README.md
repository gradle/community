# Gradle Build Tool - 2024 Software Developer Survey

The Gradle team is committed to enhancing developer experience,
as one of the top priorities on the [Gradle Roadmap](../../roadmap/README.md/).
Your feedback is crucial in helping us prioritize our efforts!
The survey will be open for responses until the end of the year,
and we intend to make it a recurrent event.

!!! note "2024 Developer Survey is Over"
  
  On November 06, we concluded the 2024 Software Developer Survey.
  Thanks to 500+ Gradle users who shared substantial feedback on Gradle developer experience, key pain points, and Gradle’s future evolution!
  It will take us a few months to fully process the survey results, contact key respondents for interview opportunities, and distribute the swag.
  We appreciate your patience, and we hope to publish a full survey report in early 2025.

## Take the Survey

For now, a short feedback form is available below for everyone to continue to share their thoughts.  
You can take the survey [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3ZYZ9GB),
and we will make sure to review your feedback and, when possible, include in the 2024 report.

## Swag

We offer a gift card raffle for anonymous responses.
The most active participants, who provide substantial feedback and participate in follow-up interviews with us,
will get special edition Gradle swag.
To participate in the raffle,
submit your feedback by October 31st, 2024.
