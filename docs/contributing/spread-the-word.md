As any open source project, we rely on Gradle community members to share news and learnings
on social media, blogs and other public channels.
All content contributons are welcome!

## Channels

### Social Media

When sharing on social media, consider using the `#gradle` hashtag or
tagging Gradle directly. Our accounts are:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gradle) company page
- [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/gradle) (`@gradle`)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GradleInc) (`@GradleInc`)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Gradle) (`@gradle`)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gradleinc) (`@gradleinc`)

We also monitor the `#gradle` hashtag across major social media and blog platforms,
and we will do our best to promote quality content there.

### Community News on Slack

On the [Gradle Community Slack](./community-slack.md), we have a `#community-news` channel.
Everyone is invioted to share their highlights there,
whether it is a new presentation, blog, or a plugin release!

### Newsletter

Gradle Build Tool has a [Monthly Newsletter](https://newsletter.gradle.org/) that is maintained by the team.
This newsletter is formed based on the news we discover in the community channels.
Every month, we also start a public Call for Proposals as a GitHub issue in [gradle/community](https://github.com/gradle/community/issues).

## Gradle Fellowship

The Gradle Fellowship are distinguished engineers from the Gradle community who, through collaboration and advocacy, encourage build tooling best practices.
In addition to large scale community support, Fellows donate their time and talent to help the next generation of Gradle Fellowship members through direct one-on-one mentoring.

See the list of people on the [Gradle Fellows Page](https://gradle.org/fellowship/).
