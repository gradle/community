# Contributing to Gradle

As in any open-source project, contributions to Gradle are welcome!
Gradle Build Too itself, its documentation, many plugins and tools within Gradle's ecosystem are open-source,
and you can contribute anywhere.
See the links on the left for particular contributing guidelines.

## For Newcomers

If you are a newcomer contributor,
note that Gradle has a quite steep learning curve.
As the foundational developer tool used by millions,
there are high expectations about stability and maintainability of the submitted code and documentation.
The main [gradle/gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle)
has quite strict rules and requirements,
and it may take a while till your changes are merged and released.

If you are just starting your journey in open source and
do not aim fixing a specific issue impacting you,
iut is highly recommended to start from plugins and smaller repositories
where the entry bar is much lower.

## Key Channels

### Community Slack

We have a community Slack on the `gradle-community` workspace.
This is a main channel for Q&A and quick discussions.

- [Join the Community Slack](https://gradle.org/slack-invite)
- Use the `#contributing` channel if you need any help with contributing
  changes to gradle and getting them over the line.
- We have a searchable Slack archive [here](https://www.linen.dev/s/gradle-community).

Learn more about Slack and the communication best practices on [this page](./community-slack.md).

### Gradle Forums

We run Gradle Forums on Discourse: [discuss.gradle.org](https://discuss.gradle.org).
This channel is designed for long-term conversations, e.g.
project and architecture proposals.

### GitHub

We use GitHub Issues and Projects to cooperate.
You may find GitHub Issues on all public repositories.
For the Gradle Build Tool as whole,
we use issues in the main [gradle/gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues) repository.

Quick links:

- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agradle+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen&type=issues) -
  Issues for newcomers who just start contributing to Gradle
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agradle+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aopen&type=issues) -
  Issues for more experienced contributors that are open for grabs

At the moment we do not have GitHub Discussions and Wiki in the main repositories,
most of the discussions are expected to happen in GitHub Issues.
Other repositories may offer different discussion channels.
