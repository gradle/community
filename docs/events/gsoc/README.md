[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global,
online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.
GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project
under the guidance of mentors.
Gradle has participated in GSoC since 2023.

## GSoC 2025

[![GSoC Channel on the Gradle Community Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-%23gsoc-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack)](http://slack.gradle.org/)

In 2025, we participate under the umbrella of the [Kotlin Foundation](https://kotlinfoundation.org/).
There might be also related projects in other mentoring organizations.

### Projects

In the Kotlin Foundation, we have the following Gradle focused projects this year:

- [Gradle Convention Plugin for Developing Jenkins Plugins](./2025/jenkins-plugins-toolchain.md) by Aarav Mahajan
- [Improving Configuration Cache and lock contention in key Gradle plugins](./2025/configuration-cache-and-lock-contention.md) by Nouran Atef
- [Enhanced Kotlin Code Quality Reporting with Gradle Problems API: Integration with Detekt and Ktlint](./2025/kotlin-code-quality-with-problems-api.md) by Vanessa Johnson
- [Maven Central publishing plugin for Gradle with new APIs](./2025/maven-central-publishing-with-new-api.md) by Yongjun Hong

### For Contributors/Mentees

See the project descriptions for references to particular newcomer-friendly issues or
learning scenarios.
If nothing is available there, it is recommended to start learning Gradle basics, if you aren't already familiar with them.
Then, we recommend looking into some of the newcomer-friendly issues in the target project or in Gradle as whole.
Prior track of contributions during the application phase is important during the project proposal reviews,
because it helps us to build impression about the candidate.

To get started:

1. Join the `#gsoc` channel on the [Gradle community Slack](https://gradle.org/slack-invite).
  If there are such channels in the foundations, please join them too
2. Explore the [Getting Started with Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started_eng.html) and the relevant [topic-specific Gradle Guides](https://gradle.org/guides/)
3. Check out the [contributing guidelines](../../contributing/README.md), try addressing some of the newcomer friendly issues
4. Discuss the project ideas with your mentors on the public channels

- [Best practices for GSoC contributors](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/),
  by the Jenkins community - we will be using a similar framework

### For Mentors

We invite Gradle community members, if they are interested in mentoring, to submit their project ideas.

Mentoring requires a time commitment of several hours a week.
It is a great opportunity to have someone prototyping your idea
that it is not on the short term roadmap
but remains interesting to you and valuable to the Gradle community.
